# The goal of this program is to produce an index to all of the names on Fancy 3 and fanac.org with links to everything interesting about them.
# We'll construct a master list of names with a preferred name and zero or more variants.
# This master list will be derived from Fancy with additions from fanac.org
# The list of interesting links will include all links in Fancy 3, and all non-housekeeping links in fanac.org
#   A housekeeping link is one where someone is credited as a photographer or having done scanning or the like
# The links will be sorted by importance
#   This may be no more than putting the Fancy 3 article first, links to fanzines they edited next, and everything else after that

# The strategy is to start with Fancy 3 and get that working, then bring in fanac.org.
# This program produces a comprehensive index on Fancy 3, including a list of all people names n Fancy 3.
# This is written to files which are used as input to the indexer for Fanac.org which produces the final result.

# We'll work entirely on the local copies of the two sites.

# For Fancy 3 on MediaWiki, there are many names to keep track of for each page:
#       The actual, real-world name.  But this can't always be used for a filename on Windows or a page name in Mediawiki, so:
#       WikiPagename -- the name of the MediaWiki page it was created with and as it appears in a simple Mediawiki link.
#       URLname -- the name of the Mediawiki page in a URL
#                       Basically, spaces are replaced by underscores and the first character is always UC.  #TODO: What about colons? Other special characters?
#       WindowsFilename -- the name of the Windows file in the in the local site: converted using methods in HelperPackage. These names can be derived from the Mediawiki page name and vice-versa.
#       WikiDisplayname -- the display name in MediaWiki: Normally the name of the page, but can be overridden on the page using DISPLAYTITLE
#
#       The URLname and WindowsFilename can be derived from the WikiPagename, but not necessarily vice-versa

#TODO: Revise this

# There will be a dictionary, nameVariants, indexed by every form of every name. The value will be the canonical form of the name.
# There will be a second dictionary, people, indexed by the canonical name and containing an unordered list of Reference structures
# A Reference will contain:
#       The canonical name
#       The as-used name
#       An importance code (initially 1, 2 or 3 with 3 being least important)
#       If a reference to Fancy, the name of the page (else None)
#       If a reference to fanac.org, the URL of the relevant page (else None)
#       If a redirect, the redirect name
